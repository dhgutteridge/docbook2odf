# docbook2odf

Style sheets and utilities to transform DocBook XML to OpenDocument format.
More detailed (historical) information is available at
[open.comsultia.com/docbook2odf](http://open.comsultia.com/docbook2odf).

This project is forked from
[dmoonfire/docbook2odf](https://github.com/dmoonfire/docbook2odf).
Its intentions are different: there are various issues with the Perl
scripts and man page supplied, and the goal is simply to fix those, at
which point they can be integrated back into the other project. Since
the other project's goal is to migrate support from DocBook 4 to 5,
this project may also be useful for maintaining the existing DocBook 4
support for those still using that version, since the original upstream
project appears to be long abandoned.
